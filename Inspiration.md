## Where can we use Machine learning, we are using Heuristics to make a decision!

* Compilers: instructions scheduling, register allocation, loop nest parallelization strategies, ...

* Networking: TCP window size decisions, backoff for retransmits, data compression, ... 

* Operation systems: process scheduling, buffer cache, insertion/replacement, file system perfecting, ...

* Job scheduling systems: which tasks/VMs to co-locate on same machine, which tasks to pre-empt, ...

* Asic desgin: physical circuit layout, test case selection, ...

* Flags: Any where we've punted to a user tunable performance options, many programs have huge numbers of tunable
 command line flags, usually not changed from their defaults
