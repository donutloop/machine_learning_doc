# Data versioning 

 ## Collaboration 
 
 Despite what you see on social media, there are no data science and machine learning unicorns (that is, people with knowledge and capabilities in every area of data science and machine learning). We need to have our colleagues' reviews and improve on our work, and this is impossible if they aren't able to reproduce our model results and analyses. 
 
 ## Creativity 
 I don't know about you, but I have trouble remembering even what I did yesterday. We can't trust ourselves to always remember our reasoning and logic, especially when we are dealing with machine learning workflows. We need to track exactly what data we are using, what results we created, and how we created them. This is the only way we will be able to continually improve our models and techniques. 
 
 ## Compliance
 Finally, we may not have a choice regarding data versioning and reproducibility in machine learning very soon. Laws are being passed around the world (for example, the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) in the European Union) that give users a right to an explanation for algorithmically made decisions. We simply cannot hope to comply with these rulings if we don't have a robust way of tracking what data we are processing and what results we are producing.
