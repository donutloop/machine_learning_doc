# classification model

* Categories , labels , or classes : These terms are used interchangeably to represent the various distinct choices for our prediction. For example, we could have a fraud class and a not fraud class, or we could have sitting, standing, running, and walking categories. 

* Binary classification : This type of classification is one with only two categories or classes, such as yes/no or fraud/not fraud. *

* Multi-class classification : This type of classification is one with more than two classes, such as a classification trying to assign one of hot dog, airplane, cat, and so on, to an image.

* Labeled data or annotated data : Real-world observations or records that have been paired with their corresponding class. For example, if we are predicting fraud via transaction time, this data would include a bunch of measured transaction times along with a corresponding label indicating whether they were fraudulent or not.
